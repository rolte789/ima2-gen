# API Reference

This document lists the local HTTP API exposed by `ima2 serve`.

Base URL:

```text
http://localhost:3333
```

## Provider Policy

Image generation supports both OAuth and API-key providers.

- `provider: "oauth"` uses the local Codex OAuth proxy.
- `provider: "api"` uses the OpenAI Responses API with the hosted `image_generation` tool.
- API-key generation covers classic generate, edit, mask-guided edit, multimode, and node generation.
- If `provider: "api"` is requested without an API key, routes fail before upstream with `401` and `API_KEY_REQUIRED`.
- Mask edits are mask/selection guided edits, not pixel-perfect inpaint guarantees.

## Health And Status

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Server health, version, paths, provider policy |
| `GET` | `/api/providers` | Provider availability and runtime ports |
| `GET` | `/api/oauth/status` | OAuth proxy status and visible models |
| `GET` | `/api/billing` | Billing/status probe, including API key source when configured |

## Storage

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/storage/status` | Summarized gallery storage status for support UI |
| `POST` | `/api/storage/open-generated-dir` | Ask the server process to open the generated image folder |

`GET /api/storage/status` returns a support-safe summary, not raw legacy path arrays by default.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "generatedDirLabel": "~/.ima2/generated",
    "generatedCount": 0,
    "legacyCandidatesScanned": 18,
    "legacySourcesFound": 0,
    "legacyFilesFound": 0,
    "state": "not_found",
    "messageKind": "apology",
    "recoveryDocsPath": "docs/RECOVER_OLD_IMAGES.md",
    "doctorCommand": "ima2 doctor",
    "overrides": {
      "generatedDir": false,
      "configDir": false
    }
  }
}
```

Storage `state` values:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Current gallery has files or no recovery notice is needed |
| `recoverable` | Legacy folders/files are still present and may be recoverable |
| `not_found` | Current gallery is empty and no legacy folder was found |
| `unknown` | Storage status inspection failed or was incomplete |

`POST /api/storage/open-generated-dir` opens the generated image folder on the machine running `ima2 serve`. If the browser is connected to a remote server, VM, container, WSL instance, or another computer on the network, this action targets that server machine, not necessarily the browser device.

## In-Flight Jobs

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/inflight` | Active jobs only by default |
| `GET` | `/api/inflight?includeTerminal=1` | Includes recent terminal jobs for debugging |
| `DELETE` | `/api/inflight/:requestId` | Cancel or forget an active job |

In-flight logs and responses use `requestId` for correlation. Logs should not include raw prompts, reference data URLs, generated base64, tokens, cookies, auth headers, or raw upstream bodies.

## Generation

### `POST /api/generate`

Text-to-image and reference-guided root generation.

```json
{
  "prompt": "a shiba in space",
  "quality": "medium",
  "size": "1024x1024",
  "format": "png",
  "moderation": "low",
  "provider": "oauth",
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "references": [],
  "requestId": "optional-client-id"
}
```

Supported quality values: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

Supported moderation values: `auto`, `low`.

Recommended model: `gpt-5.4`. Current app default: `gpt-5.4-mini`. `gpt-5.5` is the strongest quality option when supported, but callers should expect higher quota pressure and possible Codex CLI/backend capability requirements.

### `POST /api/edit`

Image edit / image-to-image generation.

The request includes a prompt and image payload. `provider: "api"` sends the prompt and image through the shared Responses image adapter. Optional masks are forwarded as mask guidance, not a pixel-perfect edit guarantee.

### `POST /api/node/generate`

Node-mode generation and child edits.

Body fields:

```json
{
  "parentNodeId": "optional-server-node-id",
  "prompt": "continue this image",
  "quality": "medium",
  "size": "1024x1024",
  "format": "png",
  "moderation": "low",
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "references": [],
  "externalSrc": "optional-history-url",
  "sessionId": "session-id",
  "clientNodeId": "client-node-id",
  "requestId": "request-id",
  "provider": "oauth"
}
```

When `parentNodeId` is present, the server loads the stored parent node image and uses the edit path. Extra node references are currently supported only for root nodes.

The route can stream Server-Sent Events when the client sends `Accept: text/event-stream`. Possible events include `phase`, `partial`, `done`, and `error`.

### `GET /api/node/:nodeId`

Fetch stored node metadata and asset URL.

## Reference Images

Reference uploads are capped at 5 items. The frontend compresses large JPEG/PNG files before sending them. HEIC/HEIF files are rejected with a user-facing conversion hint.

Server-side validation may return these reference codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `REF_NOT_ARRAY` | `references` was not an array |
| `REF_TOO_MANY` | More than the configured reference count |
| `REF_NOT_STRING` | A reference item was not a string |
| `REF_EMPTY` | A reference item was empty |
| `REF_TOO_LARGE` | A reference exceeded the configured base64 size |
| `REF_NOT_BASE64` | A reference was not valid base64 |

## History

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/history` | List generated assets |
| `GET` | `/api/history?groupBy=session` | Group assets by session title |
| `DELETE` | `/api/history/:filename` | Tombstone a generated asset |
| `POST` | `/api/history/:filename/restore` | Restore a recently deleted asset |

History rows can include node metadata such as `sessionId`, `nodeId`, `clientNodeId`, `requestId`, and `refsCount`.

## Sessions And Graphs

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/sessions` | List graph sessions |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions` | Create a session |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/:id` | Load a session and graph |
| `PATCH` | `/api/sessions/:id` | Rename a session |
| `DELETE` | `/api/sessions/:id` | Delete a session |
| `PUT` | `/api/sessions/:id/graph` | Save graph snapshot |

`PUT /api/sessions/:id/graph` requires an `If-Match` header containing the current graph version.

Version mismatch returns `GRAPH_VERSION_CONFLICT` and the current version. This only means the client saved against a stale graph version; it is not proof that another browser tab changed the graph.

Graph save requests may include observability headers:

```text
X-Ima2-Graph-Save-Id
X-Ima2-Graph-Save-Reason
X-Ima2-Tab-Id
```

## Style Sheets

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/:id/style-sheet` | Load session style sheet |
| `PUT` | `/api/sessions/:id/style-sheet` | Save style sheet |
| `PATCH` | `/api/sessions/:id/style-sheet/enabled` | Toggle style sheet usage |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/:id/style-sheet/extract` | Extract style fields from prompt/reference |

Style-sheet extraction can require an API key/openai client. Image generation also supports `provider: "api"` through the shared Responses API image adapter when an API key is configured.

## Common Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `API_KEY_REQUIRED` | `provider: "api"` was requested without a configured API key |
| `APIKEY_DISABLED` | Legacy/deprecated hard-block code from older builds |
| `INVALID_IMAGE_MODEL` | Model name is unknown or unsupported |
| `IMAGE_MODEL_UNSUPPORTED` | Model exists but cannot use image generation |
| `INVALID_REQUEST` | Upstream request parameters are invalid; raw provider details may be included as `upstreamCode`, `upstreamType`, and `upstreamParam` |
| `INVALID_MODERATION` | Moderation value is not `auto` or `low` |
| `SAFETY_REFUSAL` | Upstream safety refusal |
| `MODERATION_REFUSED` | Content generation refused by moderation |
| `AUTH_CHATGPT_EXPIRED` | Codex/ChatGPT OAuth session expired |
| `AUTH_API_KEY_INVALID` | API key is invalid, revoked, out of quota, or wrong org |
| `NETWORK_FAILED` | Network, proxy, VPN, or firewall failure |
| `OAUTH_UNAVAILABLE` | Local OAuth proxy is not available |
| `OPEN_GENERATED_DIR_FAILED` | The server could not open the generated image folder |
| `GRAPH_VERSION_REQUIRED` | Missing graph `If-Match` header |
| `GRAPH_VERSION_CONFLICT` | Stale graph version |
| `GRAPH_TOO_LARGE` | Graph exceeds node/edge limits |
| `NODE_NOT_FOUND` | Node metadata was not found |

## Endpoint → CLI Mapping

Most server routes under `/api/*` have a CLI wrapper. The exceptions are server + web-UI-only surfaces: **Agent Mode** (`/api/agent/*`) and the **prompt builder** (`POST /api/prompt-builder/chat`) have no `ima2` subcommand. Use this table to find the command that calls a given endpoint. (See README.md "Client" section for full flag lists.)

| Endpoint | CLI |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/generate` | `ima2 gen` |
| `POST /api/edit` | `ima2 edit` |
| `POST /api/generate/multimode` (SSE) | `ima2 multimode` |
| `POST /api/node/generate` (SSE) / `GET /api/node/:id` | `ima2 node generate` / `ima2 node show` |
| `GET /api/history` | `ima2 ls` |
| `DELETE /api/history/:name` / `…/permanent` | `ima2 history rm [--permanent]` |
| `POST /api/history/restore` | `ima2 history restore --trash-id` |
| `POST /api/history/favorite` | `ima2 history favorite` |
| `POST /api/history/import-local` | `ima2 history import` |
| `POST /api/metadata/read` | `ima2 metadata` / `ima2 show --metadata` |
| `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/sessions[/…]` | `ima2 session ls/show/create/rm/rename` |
| `GET/PUT /api/sessions/:id/graph` | `ima2 session graph load/save` |
| `GET/PUT /api/sessions/:id/style-sheet[/…]` | `ima2 session style-sheet …` |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/annotations/:name` | `ima2 annotate get/set/rm` |
| `POST /api/canvas-versions` / `PUT /api/canvas-versions/:name` | `ima2 canvas-versions save/update` |
| `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/prompts[/…]` | `ima2 prompt …` |
| `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/prompts/folders[/…]` | `ima2 prompt folder …` |
| `…/api/prompts/import/…` | `ima2 prompt import sources/refresh/curated/discovery/folder` |
| `…/api/cardnews/…` (gated on `features.cardNews`) | `ima2 cardnews …` |
| `POST /api/comfy/export-image` | `ima2 comfy export` |
| `GET /api/inflight` / `DELETE /api/inflight/:id` | `ima2 inflight ls` (alias `ps`) / `ima2 inflight rm` (alias `cancel`) |
| `GET /api/storage/status` / `POST /api/storage/open-generated-dir` | `ima2 storage status` / `ima2 storage open` |
| `GET /api/billing` / `GET /api/providers` / `GET /api/oauth/status` | `ima2 billing` / `ima2 providers` / `ima2 oauth status` |
| `GET /api/health` | `ima2 ping` |
| `GET /api/capabilities` | `ima2 capabilities` |
| `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/agent/*` (sessions, turns, queue) | — (Agent Mode; web UI only, no CLI) |
| `POST /api/prompt-builder/chat` | — (prompt builder; web UI only, no CLI) |

Notes:
- `ima2 history favorite` and `ima2 annotate …` send `X-Ima2-Browser-Id: cli-<sha1prefix>` derived from the config dir, so CLI activity does not collide with browser sessions.
- `ima2 session graph save` performs a GET-then-PUT with `If-Match: "<version>"` to guard against `GRAPH_VERSION_CONFLICT`.
- `ima2 history import` and `ima2 canvas-versions save/update` send raw bytes with `Content-Type: image/<png|jpeg|webp>`; the SSE endpoints (`multimode`, `node generate`) use `Accept: text/event-stream`.
- `ima2 cardnews …` checks `runtimeConfig.features.cardNews` before calling the gated endpoints; when disabled the CLI exits 2 with a clear message instead of producing a 404.

## CLI Discovery

The server writes an advertisement file at:

```text
~/.ima2/server.json
```

CLI commands such as `ima2 ping`, `ima2 gen`, and `ima2 ls` use this file unless `--server` or `IMA2_SERVER` is provided.

Current shape:

```json
{
  "port": 3334,
  "url": "http://localhost:3334",
  "pid": 12345,
  "startedAt": 1777180000000,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "backend": {
    "configuredPort": 3333,
    "actualPort": 3334,
    "url": "http://localhost:3334"
  },
  "oauth": {
    "configuredPort": 10531,
    "actualPort": 10532,
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:10532",
    "status": "ready"
  }
}
```

Top-level `port` and `url` are kept for older CLI clients. New code should prefer `backend.url`.
