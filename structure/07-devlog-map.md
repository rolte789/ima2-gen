# Devlog Map

`image_gen/devlog` separates active plans, completed work, and exploratory notes. In the current working tree, `_plan` contains the active lane, `_fin` contains completed implementation and completed experiments, and `_spikes` contains older UX exploration notes. This document explains which devlog files are current references and which are only historical context.

This map matters because plans from multiple eras coexist. `_plan/README.md` is the current source of truth for active lanes; there is no current `devlog/_plan/unified-roadmap.md` file. Completed implementation records live under `_fin/`, including the old 0.09 stabilization work, card-news, prompt-library import, ComfyUI bridge, Canvas Mode core phases, and recent Gallery/Canvas navigation fixes. Structure docs should follow the current code and active roadmap rather than stale plan folders.

For planning work, read `_plan/README.md` first. As of 2026-05-13 the TypeScript migration gate is closed and archived; App Weight Reduction #36 is archived under `_fin/260429_app-weight-reduction`; CLI feature-parity #45 (commit 9698fc1) is shipped and follow-up CLI drift is implemented in #61. After the 2026-04-30 naming-standard pass, the active lane is centered on Canvas Mode follow-ons (`260429_issue46-blank-canvas-paint-to-ai/`), inflight reload reconcile (#47), prompt import search UX (#48), post-TS mobile/community UX plans (`260428_issue33-mobile-overhaul-logs/`, `260429_community-ux-split-triage/`, #37-#43), Canvas Intelligence issue subplans (`260430_issue27/28/31`), the `260428_censorship-bypass-research` reference, issue #59 first-node action, issue #60 multimode progress closeout, and issue #62 CLI skill/capability discovery.

## Structure Docs Versus Devlog

| Category | Structure docs | Devlog |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Evergreen reference for current code structure | Plans, decisions, completed work |
| Update trigger | Code contracts change | Phase starts, phase completes, spike is archived |
| Style | Current-tense operational reference | Plans, reviews, experiments, retrospectives |
| Example | `03-server-api.md` | `_plan/backend-node-mode.md` |

Structure docs do not replace devlog. They normalize devlog decisions against the current code. If an older devlog contradicts current code, prefer current code and the active roadmap.

## Cleanup Checklist

- [ ] If `_plan/README.md` changes, update this roadmap summary.
- [ ] If a devlog folder moves to `_fin`, `_plan/_legacy`, or `_spikes`, update the reference tables.
- [ ] If a `server.js` split phase starts, update `[[01-file-function-map]]`, `[[03-server-api]]`, and `[[06-infra-operations]]`.
- [ ] If node-mode UX changes, update `[[04-frontend-architecture]]` and `[[05-node-mode]]`.
- [ ] If externally researched content is copied into structure docs, include direct `> Source:` links in the target doc.

- 2026-04-26: Archived `0.09.17`, `0.09.17.1`, `0.09.29`, and `0.09.30` to `_fin/260426_*`. Deleted `0.09.18-metrics-observability` from `_plan`. Updated roadmap summary and reference tables.
- 2026-04-28: Refreshed the active lane to span `0.09.31`-`0.09.41`, the `0.20-card-news` and `0.23-prompt-library` feature tracks, and the `1.1.5-windows-open-folder-fix` patch lane. Added `_fin/260426_0.22-gallery-navigation-ux`, `_fin/260427_0.09.33-upstream-validation-errors`, and `_spikes/260425_image_creator_skill` to the reference tables. Updated the devlog structure diagram and roadmap summary for ima2-gen 1.1.5.
- 2026-04-29: Refreshed active lane from actual `_plan` folders. Removed stale `unified-roadmap.md` references, marked completed 0.09.31-.40, 0.20, 0.23, 1.1.5 lanes archived, and added active mobile UX, Canvas Intelligence, App Weight Reduction, and TypeScript migration tracks.
- 2026-04-29: Added Oracle browser `gpt-5-pro` post-TypeScript roadmap split. Created post-TS plan entries for #37-#43 and Canvas Intelligence subplans for #31/#27/#28, while leaving TypeScript migration untouched as the current gate.
- 2026-04-29: Moved TypeScript migration to `_fin/260429_typescript-migration` after merge to `main`; the then-open #24 observation note was later superseded and #24 is now closed. `0.26-app-weight-reduction` stayed active until the later #36 post-TS verification closeout.
- 2026-04-29: Archived `0.26-app-weight-reduction` into `_fin/260429_app-weight-reduction` after Phase C closeout verification. Next post-TS active implementation lane is #37 mobile settings workspace.
- 2026-04-30: Refreshed the active lane to match the working tree — added `0.20-card-news`, `0.24-canvas-mode`, `260429_blank_canvas_paint_to_ai`, `260429_canvas_continue_prompt_block`, `260429_prompt_import_search_ux`, `260429_issue45-cli-feature-parity`, and `260429_issue47-inflight-reload-reconcile`. Recorded the new `_fin` archives for `260428_0.09.42-`, `260428_0.09.43-`, `260428_0.09.49-`, `260428_0.20-card-news-`, `260428_0.23-prompt-library-`, and `260428_1.1.5-windows-open-folder-fix`. CLI feature-parity #45 (commit 9698fc1) is shipped; Canvas Mode workspace split (#11bc214) lives under the active `0.24-canvas-mode/` plan.
- 2026-04-30 (naming-standard pass): renamed `_plan/` folders to the `YYMMDD_issue<NN>-<slug>` / `YYMMDD_<slug>` standard. `0.09.41-censorship-bypass` → `260428_censorship-bypass-research`. `0.20-card-news` → `260426_card-news-smoke-qa-harness`. `0.99_future` moved out to `devlog/_future/0.99_future-deferred-ops/`. The four `260428_0.09.45..0.09.48-*` folders consolidated into `260428_issue33-mobile-overhaul-logs/` (PHASE-NN subdocs). `260429_blank_canvas_paint_to_ai` → `260429_issue46-blank-canvas-paint-to-ai`. `260429_community_ux_split` → `260429_community-ux-split-triage`. New issues #48 and #49 filed for `260429_issue48-prompt-import-search-ux` and `260430_issue49-api-provider-responses` respectively.
- 2026-05-06: Added `_plan/260503_error-toast-stack/` (shipped 2026-05-06, commit 78cb6d4). Marked #42 (`260429_issue42-gallery-current-session-default`), #43 (`260429_issue43-settings-persistence-audit`), and #49 (`260430_issue49-api-provider-responses`) as shipped, and #31 (`260430_issue31-provider-masked-edit`) as groundwork-shipped behind the `IMA2_OAUTH_MASKED_EDIT_ENABLED` flag. Noted that `_plan/260430_issue24-typescript-strict-cleanup/` shipped via PR #50 (commit 7367333) — split `lib/oauthProxy.ts` into `lib/oauthProxy/*` and added `lib/runtimeContext.ts` / `lib/responsesImageAdapter.ts` / `lib/providerOptions.ts` / `lib/errInfo.ts`. v1.1.9 (commit 6e82357) and v1.1.10 (commit 8855ef0) released.
- 2026-05-10: Added `_plan/260510_issue61-cli-feature-parity-audit/` after auditing CLI web-search and current server/UI parity. #61 was opened for implementation. Updated #24 wording to closed/current rather than observation tracking.
- 2026-05-11: Archived `_fin/260510_issue61-cli-feature-parity-audit/` after implementing CLI provider overrides, multimode refs/mode, multimode inflight help, server-side favorites listing, and CLI payload tests.
- 2026-05-13: Added active `_plan/260513_issue62-cli-skill-capabilities/` for packaged agent skill and CLI capability/default discovery.
