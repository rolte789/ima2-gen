# Frontend Architecture

The current `ima2-gen` web UI is the React app under `ui/src/`. The server serves the built bundle under `ui/dist/`. The old single-file HTML UI remains as `public/index.html.legacy`, but it is not the active entrypoint.

This matters because README and older devlog entries still contain traces of the vanilla HTML UI. Actual UI work should target React components, the Zustand store, `ui/src/lib/api.ts` / `ui/src/lib/nodeApi.ts`, and `ui/src/index.css`. Fixing the legacy HTML file will not change the active app.

Start UI work at `App.tsx` to understand how classic canvas and node canvas diverge. General server calls are in `ui/src/lib/api.ts`; node generation JSON/SSE calls are in `ui/src/lib/nodeApi.ts` and re-exported through `api.ts`. State is centralized in `ui/src/store/useAppStore.ts`. For screen-level structure, start with `Sidebar`, `Canvas`, `NodeCanvas`, `RightPanel`, and `GalleryModal`.

Snapshot note, 2026-04-30: mobile UI has dedicated components (`MobileAppBar`, `MobileComposeSheet`, `MobileSettingsToggle`) and hooks (`useIsMobile`, `useVisualViewportInset`). Canvas Mode UI has been split out of a single component (`refactor(ui): split canvas mode workspace`, commit 11bc214) into `ui/src/components/canvas-mode/` (~3300 lines across 23 files), with `CanvasModeWorkspace.tsx` (498) as the shell, `CanvasToolbar.tsx` (468) for tools, and `useCanvasBackgroundCleanup.ts` (454) for the dual-mask cleanup flow. Background cleanup preview work has stale-render cancellation/debounce guards while final apply/export paths preserve natural image dimensions. Multimode sequence preview (`MultimodeSequencePreview`), web-search/reasoning-effort controls (`WebSearchToggle`, `ReasoningEffortSelect`), trash undo (`TrashUndoToast`), and history strip (`HistoryStrip` + layout toggle) are all part of the active component surface. There is no separate `ui/src/lib/imageMetadataClient.ts`; metadata restore calls live in `ui/src/lib/api.ts`.

Snapshot note, 2026-05-06: gallery now defaults to the current session with an "All Images" toggle (#42, commit bbf9b08). The store exposes `galleryScope: "current-session" | "all"`, `galleryDefaultScope`, and matching setters; opening the gallery resets `galleryScope` to `galleryDefaultScope` so the default is sticky across sessions. All `ima2.*` localStorage key names — including `ima2.galleryScope` and `ima2.galleryDefaultScope` — are now centralized in `ui/src/store/persistenceRegistry.ts` (#43, commit 246696d), preventing drift between hydration helpers and setters; settings/canvas persistence hardening (commit 5e3aed3) consumes the same registry. Error toasts now stack at the bottom-right with per-toast dismissal instead of replacing each other (commit 78cb6d4 + `tests/toast-stack-contract.test.js`); `Toast.tsx` is the renderer and the store keeps an array of error entries. Mobile compose/settings flows received UX polish (commits ad78853 / c812598) with an explicit mobile generate entry (`tests/mobile-generate-entry-contract.test.js`). Reasoning-effort controls are disabled for image-only models (commit 18b9123). `useAppStore.ts` grew to 3715 lines.

## Render Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    MAIN["main.tsx"] --> APP["App.tsx"]
    APP --> STORE["useAppStore"]
    APP --> SIDEBAR["Sidebar"]
    APP --> SETTINGS["SettingsWorkspace"]
    APP --> CLASSIC["Canvas"]
    APP --> NODE["NodeCanvas"]
    APP --> RIGHT["RightPanel"]
    APP --> MODAL["GalleryModal"]
    STORE --> API["ui/src/lib/api.ts"]
    API --> NODEAPI["ui/src/lib/nodeApi.ts"]
    API --> SERVER["server.ts /api"]
    NODEAPI --> SERVER
```

`App.tsx` hydrates history, loads sessions, reconciles inflight jobs, starts polling on mount, and syncs theme preference. If settings are open, it renders `SettingsWorkspace` in the center slot. Otherwise, if UI mode is `classic`, it renders `Canvas`; if node mode is enabled and UI mode is `node`, it renders `NodeCanvas`. Node mode is enabled in packaged builds by default and can be hidden only by building with `VITE_IMA2_NODE_MODE=0`. Before unload or visibility changes, it flushes the graph save beacon.

Settings are a workspace replacement, not a modal overlay. `SettingsButton` lives next to the `ima2-gen` title in the sidebar. The compact image model selector also lives in this header as a fast switcher, while Settings shows the same choice with full model names. `SettingsWorkspace` keeps the outer shell fixed so the header and `X` close button do not scroll away; only the section index and content pane scroll. Selecting an item jumps the center document to that section instead of replacing the content panel. `SettingsWorkspace` closes with `X` or Escape and returns to the previous canvas path without mutating generation state.

| Right panel | `RightPanel.tsx`, `SizePicker.tsx`, `CostEstimate.tsx` | Quality, size, format, moderation, count |
| History | `HistoryStrip.tsx`, `GalleryModal.tsx`, `ResultActions.tsx` | Saved image browsing, favorite, restore, drag-out, and metadata-restore actions |

| Card-news (dev-only) | `ui/src/components/card-news/*`, `ui/src/store/cardNewsStore.ts`, `ui/src/lib/cardNewsApi.ts` | Topic→draft→template→generate→export flow, gated by `VITE_IMA2_CARD_NEWS=1` or `VITE_IMA2_DEV=1` |
| i18n | `ui/src/i18n/index.ts`, `ko.json`, `en.json` | Locale load/save and translation lookup |

## State Model

| State group | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Generation options | `useAppStore.ts` | Provider, quality, size, format, moderation, image model, count |
| Prompt/reference | `useAppStore.ts` | Prompt, reference images, add/remove/clear helpers |
| Classic history | `useAppStore.ts` plus `/api/history` | Current image, history, gallery scope (`current-session` / `all`), gallery default scope, favorite toggle |
| Inflight | `useAppStore.ts` plus `/api/inflight` | localStorage-backed pending jobs and polling |
| Node graph | `useAppStore.ts` plus sessions API | Nodes, edges, graphVersion, session actions, style sheet |
| Prompt library | `useAppStore.ts` plus `/api/prompts/*` | Open/close, current folder, search query, favorite filter, in-flight loading |
| Metadata restore | `useAppStore.ts` plus `/api/metadata/read` | Pending dropped image, parsed metadata, restore confirmation flow |
| Card-news (dev-only) | `ui/src/store/cardNewsStore.ts` plus `/api/cardnews/*` | Topic/draft/template selection, manifest, jobs, regenerate/export state |
| Settings workspace | `useAppStore.ts` | `settingsOpen` and active settings section |
| UI preferences | `localStorage` via `ui/src/store/persistenceRegistry.ts` | Right panel state, UI mode, selected filename, locale, theme, custom-size slots, dev mode flag, gallery scope/default scope, settings persistence — all key names live in `persistenceRegistry.ts` (#43) |
| Error surface | `useAppStore.ts` plus `ErrorCard.tsx`, `Toast.tsx` | `errorCard` state for actionable errors; toasts are stacked at the bottom-right with per-toast dismissal (commit 78cb6d4) |

The image model preference is stored in `localStorage` as `ima2.imageModel`. Sidebar compact labels (`5.4m`, `5.4`, `5.5`) and Settings full labels (`GPT-5.4 Mini`, `GPT-5.4`, `GPT-5.5`) both read/write the same store field, so the next classic or node request sends the selected `model` instead of falling back to the default. The sidebar selector is intentionally tiny: the closed state shows only the compact label, opens a custom menu on click, and closes on outside click or Escape.

Visible metadata should carry the selected model too. Current result metadata, hydrated history items, and ready node status labels use the server-returned or sidecar-restored `model` so UI debugging matches backend logs. The visible metadata uses compact aliases to preserve elapsed time: model aliases are `5.4m`/`5.4`/`5.5`, and quality aliases are `l`/`m`/`h`.

`useAppStore.ts` is now 3715 lines and concentrates most cross-cutting state (classic, node, history, gallery scope, prompt library, metadata restore, multimode sequence, canvas annotations and versions, web-search and reasoning-effort settings, settings, stacked toasts). The card-news store is intentionally separated into `cardNewsStore.ts` (416 lines) so the dev-only feature does not bloat the main bundle path or persistence layer. All `ima2.*` localStorage key names are sourced from `ui/src/store/persistenceRegistry.ts` (74 lines, #43) so hydration helpers, setters, and contract tests stay aligned.

## Classic UI And Node UI

| Mode | Condition | Main component | State flow |
|---|---|---|---|
| Classic | Default UI | `Canvas.tsx` | Sends prompt to `/api/generate`, then updates current image/history |
| Node | Product feature enabled | `NodeCanvas.tsx` | Calls `/api/node/generate` per node, renders partial previews when streamed, and saves the graph to the session |
| Card-news | Dev-only, gated by `VITE_IMA2_CARD_NEWS=1` or `VITE_IMA2_DEV=1` | `card-news/CardNewsWorkspace.tsx` | Drives the dev-only topic→draft→template→generate→export flow against `/api/cardnews/*` and `cardNewsStore` |

Node mode uses `@xyflow/react`. Empty canvas creates a root node. Dragging an edge from an existing node can create a child node. Session loading displays a canvas overlay.

Node generation uses SSE first through `postNodeGenerateStream()`. Partial images are stored only in transient `ImageNodeData.partialImageUrl`; they are deleted from the graph save payload. The final `done` payload replaces the preview with the canonical saved file URL. If the server returns JSON instead of SSE, the client falls back to the final-only behavior. SSE `error` payloads preserve `status` so upstream validation failures can route to the same UI surface as JSON failures.

Node selection batch actions live on the canvas, not in Settings. `NodeCanvas` exposes a compact selection bar inside the React Flow area. Selection mode treats a normal node click as selecting the whole undirected connected component. Cmd/Ctrl modifies that selection: another component is added/removed, while a node inside the selected component can be toggled as an exception. Batch regeneration is sequential and in-place for selected nodes only; it does not use the single-node ready-state sibling branch.

Ready node actions are split in `ImageNode`: `Regenerate` replaces the current node in place, while `New variant` creates and generates into a sibling node. The store preserves this action choice through custom-size confirmation so a confirmed in-place regeneration cannot accidentally take the sibling path. Node layout helpers place new roots/children using actual existing node positions instead of raw edge counts, avoiding overlap after a middle child is deleted.

Node-local image references are allowed on child/edit nodes. The child composer sends references together with the parent image instead of blocking attachment. Reference drafts remain node-local and are stripped from saved session graph payloads, but they are persisted separately in browser `localStorage` under `ima2.nodeRefs.v1` by `ui/src/lib/nodeRefStorage.ts`. This avoids base64 bloat in SQLite while keeping node chips available across normal reloads on the same browser profile.

Node edges are the source of truth for parentage. `ui/src/lib/nodeGraph.ts` derives `parentServerNodeId` from the incoming visual edge and the source node's current `serverNodeId` whenever nodes or edges are loaded, changed, connected, disconnected, or saved. `ImageNode` exposes four-direction source and target handles, and `NodeCanvas` forwards React Flow `sourceHandle`/`targetHandle` values into the store so edges reload on the same directional anchors. The handle ids are persisted in session edge `data`; parent derivation still uses only `edge.source` and `edge.target`. Node edge removal is routed explicitly instead of relying on raw React Flow edge changes. When an edge is removed, `useAppStore.disconnectEdges()` removes the visual edge and clears or recomputes the target node's `parentServerNodeId`. Selection mode disables Delete/Backspace deletion so graph selection cannot accidentally remove edges or nodes.

Node generation sends an explicit context/search policy. The default request is `contextMode: "parent-plus-refs"` and `searchMode: "off"`, so a child edit uses only the immediate parent image plus the node's explicit reference chips. Full ancestry is not silently inferred. If edit search becomes a product option, the UI must turn `searchMode` on intentionally.

Error handling is centralized. API helpers preserve `err.code` where the server sends `{ error: { code, message } }`; node helpers also preserve `err.status` from JSON or SSE error payloads. `handleError()` maps stable codes to either a toast or persistent `ErrorCard`. The card is reserved for actionable failures such as invalid request parameters, OAuth expiry, API-key authentication problems, moderation refusal, upstream 5xx, and network/proxy failure.

## Style And Layout

| File | Current signal | Caution |
|---|---|---|
| `ui/src/index.css` | 5780 lines | Large structural changes can easily create CSS drift across classic, node, canvas-mode, prompt-library, prompt-import dialog, gallery, mobile shell, and card-news surfaces |
| `ui/src/components/*.tsx` | 5263 lines (excluding `card-news/` subtree) | Component class names and CSS are tightly coupled |
| `ui/src/components/card-news/*.tsx` | Dev-only subtree | Do not touch from non-card-news work; gated behind `VITE_IMA2_CARD_NEWS=1` / `VITE_IMA2_DEV=1` |
| `ui/dist/` | Build output | Do not edit directly |
| `public/index.html.legacy` | Legacy artifact | Do not use it as the source for new active UI behavior |
