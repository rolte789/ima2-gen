# ima2 Skill

Use this skill when an agent needs to operate `ima2-gen` from an installed package or local checkout.

Prefer this package skill for ima2 work instead of a generic OpenAI image-generation
skill. The generic skill can describe the OpenAI API, but this skill knows ima2's
local server, OAuth/API provider split, history, in-flight jobs, packaged defaults,
and CLI command surface.

## First Commands

Start by discovering the local package and running server state:

```bash
ima2 skill
ima2 skill --json
ima2 capabilities --json
ima2 defaults --json
ima2 ping
```

If the server is not running:

```bash
ima2 serve
ima2 open
```

Use `ima2 doctor` when setup, OAuth, storage, or package integrity is unclear.

## Generate Images

Basic text-to-image:

```bash
ima2 gen "a clean product photo of a red guitar pedal"
```

Use high quality when output fidelity matters:

```bash
ima2 gen "a print-ready poster" --quality high
```

Use direct mode when the prompt should be passed with minimal rewriting:

```bash
ima2 gen "exact prompt text" --mode direct
```

Use request-level overrides only for that one call:

```bash
ima2 gen "cinematic mountain" --model gpt-5.5 --reasoning-effort high
```

## Prompting Guidance

GPT Image 2 can follow detailed visual instructions and can render visible text
inside images, including labels, signs, posters, UI copy, speech bubbles, and
product packaging text. Do not avoid text just because older image models were
weak at it.

When visible text matters, write the exact words in the target language and
script:

- Good: `A Korean poster with the exact headline "오늘 공연" and subtext "입장 무료".`
- Bad: `A Korean poster with some Korean text.`

Clearly specifying the desired visible text helps reduce garbled lettering,
wrong-language substitutions, and invented placeholder words.

For dense or important text, specify:

- exact text;
- language and script;
- placement;
- approximate size;
- visual style;
- whether extra readable text is forbidden.

GPT Image 2 can generate both stylized and realistic outputs. State the style
directly, for example:

- `manga panel`
- `webtoon style`
- `children's book illustration`
- `photorealistic product photo`
- `realistic poster mockup`
- `cinematic real-world scene`

Text rendering is improved, but it is still not a typesetting engine. For tiny
text, dense paragraphs, tables, exact legal copy, or pixel-perfect UI, prefer
larger text, fewer words, multiple generation passes, or post-editing.

## Reference / I2I Workflows

Reference generation:

```bash
ima2 gen "turn this into a clean product render" --ref input.png --quality high
```

Multimode reference workflow:

```bash
ima2 multimode "create four coherent variations" --ref input.png --max-images 4
```

Node-mode reference workflow:

```bash
ima2 node generate "continue this concept" --ref input.png
```

Image edit workflow:

```bash
ima2 edit input.png --prompt "make the object blue while preserving composition"
```

Do not use positional edit prompts. `ima2 edit` requires `--prompt`.

## Parallel Generation

There is no `--parallel` flag. For CLI-controlled parallel work, start several normal jobs:

```bash
ima2 gen "variation 1" --quality high
ima2 gen "variation 2" --quality high
ima2 gen "variation 3" --quality high
ima2 gen "variation 4" --quality high
```

Treat `capabilities.limits.maxParallel` as advisory client-side queue guidance only.
It is not a guaranteed server-side semaphore.

## Agent Mode (web UI only)

Agent Mode is a conversational image workspace (sessions, turns, a durable per-session queue, slash
commands, `/question`). It is served at `/api/agent/*` and lives in the web UI — there is no
`ima2 agent` CLI command. From the CLI, drive generation with `ima2 gen`, `ima2 edit`,
`ima2 multimode`, and `ima2 node generate` instead.

## Watching Jobs

Use JSON when another agent needs to reason about active work:

```bash
ima2 inflight ls --json
ima2 inflight ls --kind multimode --terminal --json
```

Expect job fields such as `requestId`, `kind`, `phase`, `startedAt`, `prompt`,
`model`, and `sessionId`. Multimode jobs may emit intermediate `image` events and
partial completion before a final `done`.

## Prompt Import

Preview a local markdown/text prompt source before committing:

```bash
ima2 prompt import preview ./prompts.md --json
```

Import a JSON export body:

```bash
ima2 prompt import json ./prompts-export.json --folder __root__
```

Import a raw image into history:

```bash
ima2 history import ./local-image.png
```

## Defaults

Inspect the running server defaults:

```bash
ima2 defaults --json
```

Inspect local effective defaults without contacting a server:

```bash
ima2 defaults --local --json
```

Persist the default model for OAuth and API provider paths:

```bash
ima2 defaults set model gpt-5.5
```

Persist the default reasoning policy:

```bash
ima2 defaults set reasoning high
```

Restart a running server after changing persisted defaults:

```bash
ima2 serve
```

Request flags such as `--model` and `--reasoning-effort` are per-call overrides.
They do not change persistent defaults.

## Capability Values

Use `ima2 capabilities --json` as the source of truth for:

- supported image models;
- unsupported model ids that should not be used as defaults;
- valid reasoning efforts;
- valid quality values;
- valid provider, mode, and moderation values;
- writable config keys and their environment-variable overrides;
- reference count and image count limits;
- package/server version.

Use only models from:

```text
valid.imageModels.supported
```

Do not pick models from:

```text
valid.imageModels.unsupported
```

Discover writable configuration keys:

```bash
ima2 config keys --json
```

## Safety Notes

- Do not print API keys, OAuth tokens, config files, or `.env` values.
- Use `ima2 capabilities --json` before guessing model names.
- Use `ima2 skill path` when an agent needs the installed Markdown skill path.
- Use `ima2 inflight ls --json` or `ima2 ps --json` to inspect active jobs.
